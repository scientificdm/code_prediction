It is very important for us to get rid of the residues from our food production operation as quick as possible and we are more or less able to feed the residues into the biogas plant the moment the waste accumulates. The waste from the processing has to be removed continuously and this works very well. The residues of the biogas plant also need to be disposed every day and this works really well as well. Our cooperation with the logistics company works flawless and this is really important to us as we are not able to store the residues.
